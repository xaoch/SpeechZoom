Maurice calling. Do you have any luck with? restaurants Yeah, we'll so we we met and what we even finding is that there aren't as you know, there aren't that many papers that have really be like hey, this is these are the contracts that make up collaboration. So what we did was we took some of the constructs from like the the csat tool from a paper from st. Cloud and we put and we made a list of guidelines from like Harrison and other papers of things you should do or you can you do you have that open down there. Yeah. Well, I was I was just about to ask have your can you yeah, let me let me Host. Yeah... Yeah, so we have a list of things that people have said, you know, this means you're a good collaborator like you share resources you build on other people's ideas, right? And then we took off and we tried to and we tag them by what sort of contracts they they applied to and we did a bit of changing of wording for things we didn't like and you know, it was a matter of perspective. They're coming from a different place, And so we're still we're still working through this a little bit but we're trying to really flesh out like which of these things are vital and how many are tied to specific guidelines for good collaboration? Interesting. So you have the indicator that is the more you know, it belongs that measured means that the paper actually off. Yeah. That's someone actually used it in a real study.

 So... nice pretty nine... Lisa. So and just just to highlight again. It's still like working progress like like Colin I will work now. We're like just because like we have to like go through it like four or five times like and re-categorize things and to be tags and stuff. So just now like that. This is not in its final state. I understand that. Yeah, I say things that I would be kind of easy to. To automatically detect colors that yeah will be kind of a kind of a challenge for example provides bass and for a four pack that went...and I think that one specifically be pulled from like the C set rubric and I'm like, okay that makes sense. But again, it's a rubric. It's not a bulb automatic. Yeah for sure I can imagine even if yeah, even for a human trying to come up with an object in question of that.

 It's it's difficult that and that's the nature of the Beast. It's this is very hard to Define some of the concepts it sometimes they said yes, sorry that I connect to that but for oral presentation everywhere I go to some kind of the same lease for representation. And basically at some point is set up as the student has been to have a good question and say okay what type of posture never really explain what's a good question because all depends is your perception of what a good job. I think the same happens here. It is very difficult to reinstate these what you are looking for even for human. Pedro Reyes one just counting and you try to make the best out of explanation there see consensus distributed. That's very true. Yeah. This this very promising even if you want with them translate this into a paper at some point if you want to have a publication off, we don't work on it. Then it will be very valuable for other people to once you first go to these work on these and have it ready to try and create this kind of off. We're not say baksana me, but really a comprehensive list of Of indicators. Yeah, I see you silly probably...somewhere. Yeah, cuz as I understand like obviously we're doing this and we're doing this kind of because like it doesn't already exist cuz it's been already existed. You just kind of be using and leveraging that off.

### PART 3 ###

Text:
 Yeah, so I definitely see that I'm useful for others. Yeah... exactly. And that's when you'll normally in research in talk about the paper. I told you I told you a glass maybe something to change the conversation that that these mystifies a little bit of a piece or what has a research paper is so it's still really fun and you did something and nobody have done that and you do poor. Okay. Maybe it's interesting for you and that's all a paper is about. Of course, you have to be for very useful for others. You have to be careful is not like okay. I came up with a list. Okay, you have to support this is the whole comprehensive because I did this you have to explain why do you need to create replaced and you see I thinks comprehensive because of that and it seems like there are all other people that contributed to this list off and then if the contribution process again as you as you say Maurice, it's not on there you created it deserves to be punished. Okay. It's pretty nice to see this and at some point and I... can share the link for this like, this is like a like a quickie platform, but just let me that you want me to drop that link and we can if you... If you can drop it in the document, I'll put a link in the in the drive included a folder you want about I think there is a game consoles are obstruents.

 I'm having I think mapping right? Excellent work. Of course, I think. Is continue adding things to this refining things it really I like your classification thing that you are just trying to put in categories off. The source is very important because sometimes especially if you want want to go for a paper we will need that information at some point so you can start adding The Source or you take this from so it's easy to forget later. Yeah, then but that's not today and I will take that next week either but in the end. The future would need to start getting some kind of different priorities and I can imagine different set of priorities. For example, what's very important what is mentioned in a lot of places? That kind of is fundamental for collaboration? That's one big goal what is easy to measure that would be another column what is more human and level of processing that we know that we are not able to to achieve by anyway, let's say assassination the best effort. I have part from putting some measuring devices on the people to measure the stress I don't think that we can. Jose with the video and they all you know that the person is even it's 100% So so the idea is to have this kind of imagining these different categories, but that's that's that's when when you have the means that we'll try to figure it out and some recommendation at least every screw. You will always find one more you will always find something else. But at some point you will see that the Additions are very very yeah, not that important. I think you you are bound to get the most of the important things in the 1st and paper that you read. Normally you will get most then you will at some point. We need to say, yeah, it's enough then you can still work on things or try to classify things that some point yourself say. Yeah, we're still there and we moved to to another phase. So thank you very much for progress. I will report in my site. I've been trying to install some sense. I have a meeting with them last week. Um, I was trying to install it in my computer. But yeah, it was like two days of okay, I do what is the very structure said there's a lever let's play that one hour.
