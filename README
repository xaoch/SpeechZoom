README

The main.py script reads an audio file from the 'data' folder, sends it to Google's speech-to-text API and reports the transcript as a new file in the 'transcript' folder.

Steps to make it work:

1) Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
example:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/service-account-file.json"

This variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again.

2) Install and initialize the Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs)

3) install the client library:
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-speech

4) run main.py file
